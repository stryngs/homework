# Homework
An interactive program designed to help children learn the basics of education they may lack in their studies.

## Lemons from lemonade
Along came a Covid and the world was forever changed.  Over a year in and the difficulties of schooling in general became quite apparent to me.  I'd failed in that regard and so homework was born.  Homework seems to help my child.  A responsibility and expectation of sorts; after all this is my child.  How can I best serve his needs while maintaining a household?

If you're a parent just like me you work that good ole 9-5.  You've got a billion things on your plate and childcare during the day to teach your child how to survive and thrive in this world was never in the playbook.

You do the typical parenting thing, but other responsibilities outweigh and take away from your child.  If only there was a way to generate interactive homework you could verify, but not spend time creating.

Yeah.

## This is a work in progress
There are so many things I want to do with this concept, but only so many hours in a day.  If you git this repo and find it useful, please let me know.  If you find it kind of stinks, please let me know.  My main feedback is from my child and of course at his age he isn't too keen on letting me know how to make the program better overall.  Truth be told I worry about him finding the loopholes I might miss.

## Encourage
That would be my best advice to my fellow parents.  Times are tough and believe me, this is a stress reliever.  Gone are the days when I needed to drum up something to help my child learn a concept.  The problem still remains, but the path is set.  As your child learns, so can homework.

Community feedback is what will drive making this a better tool for parents.  The homework you see is only as strong as the background it is built off of.  As time goes forward it will grow with my child, but it would be interesting to see higher grade levels tacked on and early.

## What age group is this geared towards?
For now, 2nd grade.

## Who is this software meant for?
Any 2nd grader who might not be getting the grades in STEM you want for your child.  In our household we are aiming for an 80% or better concept.  Not straight As, but real, and hard work meant to encourage rather than chide.

## Stay away froms
Never let this tool be a method for punishment.  It ought not be and can easily become.

## So how do I run it?
For now you need a Python 3 environment.  There are many ways to go about doing so and in this documentation we'll attempt to cover the basics.  There is no right or wrong way as it were.  Trying is paramount and all that matters.

If you need help, ask.  Do so by creating an Issue.
