# Homework
An interactive program designed to help students learn the basics of math.

## Lemons from lemonade
Along came a Covid and the world was forever changed.  Over a year in and the difficulties of schooling in general became quite apparent to me.  I'd failed in that regard and so homework was born.  Homework seems to help my child.  A responsibility and expectation of sorts; after all this is my child.  How can I best serve those needs while maintaining a household at the same time?

If you're a parent just like me, you work that good ole 9-5.  You've got a billion things on your plate and childcare during the day to teach your child how to survive and thrive in this world was never in the playbook.

You do the typical parenting thing, but other responsibilities outweigh and take away from your child.  If only there was a way to generate interactive homework you could verify, but not spend time creating.

Yeah...

## This is a work in progress
There are so many things I want to do with this concept, but only so many hours in a day.  If you git this repo and find it useful, please let me know.  If you find it kind of stinks, please let me know.  My main feedback is from my child and of course at his age he isn't too keen on letting me know how to make the program better overall.  Truth be told I worry about him finding the loopholes I might miss.

## Encourage
That would be my best advice to my fellow parents.  Times are tough and believe me, this is a stress reliever.  Gone are the days when I needed to drum up something to help my child learn a concept.  The problem still remains, but the path is set.  As your child learns, so can homework.

Community feedback is what will drive making this a better tool for parents.  The homework you see is only as strong as the background it is built off of.  As time goes forward it will grow with my child, it would be interesting to see higher grade levels tacked on and early.

## Who is this software meant for?
Any parent who might not be seeing the grades in math you want for your child.  In our household we are aiming for an 80% or better concept.  Not straight A's, but real and hard work meant to develop a sense of "I can do this!".

## Stay away froms
Never let this tool be a method for punishment.  It ought not be and can easily become.

## Initial setup steps
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## So how do I run it?
```
python3 ./homework.py
```

## How do I review my student's score?
A running tally of work is kept in student.log.  For the math problems the output can be understood as such from left to right:
- Date in YYYYMMDD
- Time in HH:MM:SS
- Question number
- Math problem
- Answered correctly or not
- Expected answer
- Received answer
